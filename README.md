Attempt to create a minimal EDK2 for Xiaomi MI 6.

Based on zhuowei's port for Pixel3XL (https://github.com/Pixel3Dev/edk2-pixel3/).

## Status 

Can load GRUB2 from a fat partition on the UFS.(/firmware is tested,you can also format the useless /cust for it)  
Windows now boots with minimal ACPI tables. (Checkout minimal-acpi branch)  

### Working

UFS Storage  
Vibrator  
...

### Not Working

...

## Building
Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

First, clone EDK2.

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git --recursive
git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms.git
```

You should have all three directories side by side.

Next, install dependencies:

18.04:

```
sudo apt install build-essential uuid-dev iasl git nasm python3-distutils gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu abootimg
```

Also see [EDK2 website](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Using-EDK-II-with-Native-GCC#Install_required_software_from_apt)

Finally, ./build.sh.

Then fastboot boot uefi.img.
